# SessionLiveQa
This app is useful to monitor the question which audience ask during presentation. The main objective of this app is that none of the audience 
member go out without having their queries answered. Most of the time all questions are not answered because of time constraint but since this
app will have list of all question which audience has asked so there is a greater chance to amswer all of them. 

Highly useful if it's used during live presentation where speaker is talking about the topic and his team member can answer queries right
at the moment question is asked.
